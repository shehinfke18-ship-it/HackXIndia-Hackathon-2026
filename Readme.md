# ⚡ Urja-Net  
### An AI-Agentic Smart Grid for Decentralized Energy Forecasting & Optimization

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Despite India’s rapid adoption of rooftop solar systems, efficient utilization of generated energy remains a challenge.

Key issues include:
- **Unpredictable Solar Generation:** Weather variability causes sudden drops in solar output.
- **Poor Energy Planning:** Households lack tools to predict solar availability and plan energy usage.
- **Grid Stress:** Low solar days increase dependence on fossil-fuel-based grid power during peak hours.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
**Urja-Net** introduces an **AI-based Energy Forecasting Agent** that predicts next-day solar energy generation using weather data and provides smart energy usage recommendations.

The system helps households:
- Plan appliance usage intelligently
- Reduce electricity bills
- Improve grid stability through proactive demand management

## 🔮 Energy Forecasting Demo (MVP)
This hackathon demo focuses on **solar energy forecasting**, which is the core intelligence behind Urja-Net.

### Demo Objective
Predict **tomorrow’s solar energy output (kWh)** using weather parameters and generate **automated energy decisions**.

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Historical weather data (sunlight, cloud cover, temperature) is used.
2. A lightweight **machine learning model** predicts next-day solar generation.
3. An AI agent evaluates the prediction.
4. The system suggests:
   - When to charge batteries / EVs
   - When to run energy-intensive appliances

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture
- **Input Data:** Weather parameters (simulated / API-based)
- **AI Model:** Linear Regression (lightweight & fast)
- **Decision Engine:** Rule-based agent
- **Output:** Predicted solar energy + usage recommendation
